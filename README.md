UAVRDD10k 

Abstract: Traditional road disease detection methods are time-consuming, labour-intensive and involve safety risks. Currently, the use of lightweight target detection algorithms and UAV platforms can automate and efficiently detect road defects. However, it still faces one important challenges: the lack of large-scale, high-quality, and diversity-rich benchmark datasets. To address these issues, we construct UAVRDD10k, which is currently the largest, best-quality, and most diversity-rich UAV road disease detection dataset, which contains 10,395 1280x1280 pixel UAV images, 7 categories, and 26,386 instances. To the best of our knowledge, UAVRDD10k is the largest, highest-quality, and most diverse open-source UAV-based pavement distress detection dataset available in this domain.
