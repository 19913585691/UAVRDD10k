Abstract: Integrating deep learning-based object detection algorithms with UAV platforms enables automated identification of pavement distress, significantly enhancing detection efficiency. However, this approach poses one critical challenges: the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality, and diversely annotated benchmark datasets. To address these challenges, we construct the UAVRDD10k dataset, comprising 10,395 UAV images (1280×1280 pixels) annotated across 7 distress categories, totaling 25,303 instances. To the best of our knowledge, UAVRDD10k represents the largest, highest-quality, and most diversely annotated UAV-based pavement distress detection dataset to date.
